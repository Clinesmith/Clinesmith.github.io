      <h1>The Lowdown on Cowtown</h1>
      <h3>Fort Worth through the Eyes of Data</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-body">
      <p>I know I still have multiple years left in college, but I’ve already done some examination of the job market, and I keep accidentally finding companies that I’d like to work for, but whose offices are in towns that I don’t want to live in. This has happened to me multiple times with Fort Worth area, so when we were assigned to find a city to research, I decided to take a closer look at Cowtown, to see if it had more to offer than what I had originally thought. It didn’t, but I’m getting ahead of myself.</p>
      <p>The first step of the process was to pull data on the 168 distinct neighborhoods in Fort Worth from city-data.com. We used web scraping to make this happen and, while web scraping is a fairly simple concept, city-data was set up in such a way that it managed to add a few exciting complications. The biggest problem is that while they use the same template for each neighborhood, that template is not organized especially intuitively, which made it difficult for me, because I really wanted to build an elegant web scraping tool, but elegance just wasn’t working for me after a certain point. It took me a good twenty hours, though, before I finally gave up and hardcoded pretty much everything. After I got that working, I was able to clean it up a little bit, and that did make me feel somewhat better.</p>
      <p>Cleaning the data was the easiest part of the project for me, largely thanks to just how intuitive Python string manipulation is. Just to back up a little, step one had gotten me twenty two columns of numerical data in a pandas dataframe, and while pandas dataframes do come with their own methods for altering strings, I prefer to write a nice clean .replace() statement than learn panda’s much bulkier methods on the fly. Once I had all the commas and cash symbols out, I used folium to look up each neighborhood’s latitude and longitude, and I used the latitude and longitude to grab information about each neighborhood's shops and venues off of foursquare.</p>
      <p>Once I had all my data in place, it was time to clarify what my goal was with this exercise. What I wanted to know was whether there was a part of town that had it all (i.e. low rent, good food, and other young people to socialize with), and if so, what part of town that was. So I built a simple model that would cluster neighborhoods together based on commonalities between income, rent, family data, nationality and more, and then after each neighborhood had been placed in a cluster, I wanted to see those clusters on a map to get an idea of which demographics live where.</p>
      <p>What I ended up with after a little trial and error was eight to ten clusters, of which about four appeared particularly frequently, and this pattern repeated on each round of clustering I applied. What I noticed is that rather than having highly distinct parts of town, each of which appealed to a different demographic for different reasons, Fort Worth, in general, contains a significant amount of homogenization across the entire city.</p>
      <p>To be clear, though, there are two parts of town that are significantly more distinct than the rest. I noticed after my second round of clustering that the area just southwest of downtown was one of these. When my clustering was based on income and rent, that southwest part of town was full of neighborhoods that had both high income and high rent. When I clustered based on family type, the entire area fell into a cluster that was notable for a high-percentage of married individuals, small household sizes, and, again, high median income. My conclusion is that if you’re young, have money, and want to raise a family, you move to the southwest portion of Fort Worth.</p>

      <p>The other area that tended to have a lot of commonalities between neighborhoods was the whole north side of town, which I really started to notice when I clustered based on nationality of origin. As it turns out, the north side of Fort Worth has a much higher immigrant population than the rest of town, as well as a high proportion of family households, and relatively low median income. Using some of trulia.com’s realtor tools, I was also able to find that a very low percentage of the north side’s population has a college degree, which tends to fit with the rest of the data I found. That’s not to say anything negative about that part of town, though. Again, based on trulia’s statistics, crime is no higher there than any other part of town, so it’s just a fairly standard low-rent district.</p>

      <p>The rest of town is hard to get a reading on. Several different clusters are all packed together, representing low rent, high rent, big families, no families and everything in between, all within a mile or two of each other. What I conclude from this is that the Dallas/Fort Worth area is a big place, and people will live wherever they can make it work. As for me, I think I’m fine leaving Texas to the Texans and staying at least a little ways north.</p>
      <p>As for changess I would make if I did this again, I would have definitely put the time in to do a little more with my foursquare venue data, as that could have led to some deeper insights, but that data was surprisingly hard to make useful, just given how much data there was to somehow sift through. Also, if I ever do web scraping again, I won’t even try to make it elegant. Web scraping is a messy process that’ll never be perfect, and I lost a lot of time by not realizing that sooner. Overall, though, I’m still fairly happy about how the project turned out. I learned what I wanted to learn about Fort Worth, and I got to do some cool stuff with data in the process. As far as I’m concerned, that’s a pretty decent time.</p>
