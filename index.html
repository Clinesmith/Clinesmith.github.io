      <p>I don’t want to move to Fort Worth after college,
        but I want to want to move to Fort Worth after college.
        The job market is extremely appealing for someone with my
        interest in embedded software, I could live near downtown
        without breaking the bank, and, given the Fort Worth is something
        of a little brother to Dallas, I’d be within 45 minutes of all of
        Dallas’ attractions without having to deal with the same traffic when
        I just want to spend a quiet night closer to home. Ultimately,
        though, I didn’t find any especially compelling reasons why I
        should make my way down to the Lone Star State after I graduate.</p>
